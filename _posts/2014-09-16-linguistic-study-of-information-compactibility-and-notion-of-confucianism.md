Interpretation of hermetical package of meanings enclosed by mere abstraction of *word*:
composed of graphical symbols and subjected to phonetic reading. They can form whole
sentences build by deep artifacts with twisted connections of *meaning* - that is timber
of art.[^1]

Data loss, product of conversion, deletion of unecessary arguments of function defining
philosophical current (the subject of this short case study) happens. The noise of
omnipotent information in our times, the disconnection from objective reality,
*short-breathness* of intertwined ideas that creates vague image from fragments
of context is creating landscape of "*today*".

When we want to talk about Confucianism, we can bring out its characteristics like
approach to the absolute and concept of Tiān[^2], respect to the ancestors and learning
a lesson from them, we can talk about rituals, definition and way to obtain virtue
or even about political system. When we consider one, the rest may fade. Notion
of Confucianism is transfomed and its meaning is transposed.
